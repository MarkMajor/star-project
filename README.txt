The Stars Project - J. Wallin

This is a project to plot star data for astrolabes,
starwheels, star maps, constellatoin maps, and other
astronomical projections.  The project uses data from 
several sources, including:

The Bright Star Catalog
The Constellation Boundary map - augmented to with additioanl points
The Constellation outline file
A list of bright stars





Things to fix:
Added a skymap.py to generate skymaps for a given date
Needs:  easier way to set time and date
        fixed constellation labels
        fixed RA/Dec lines
        cardinal directions
        better font size for nebula

Added starwheel.py
        refactoring of the astrolabe.py package


Fonts used??
